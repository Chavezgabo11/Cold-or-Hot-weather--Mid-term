	<h1>Why cold weather is better than hot?</h1>
	<p>In my case, I prefer cold weather because I'm from El Salvador the average weather is 25°C, and also we don't have a winter we only have two season summer season that always is over 28°C and our second season or cold weather are raining days, and that is like 3 or 4 months where the temperature can drop to 15°C that is a really cold day in El Salvador.</p>

	<p>Well as you can see we are always sweating which is a big problem that generates a bad smell. Further, you always get dehydrated.</p>

	<p>What I like about cold weather is that are easier to pass them than hot weather you only need to have a heated house and a big jacket, sweater or coat.</p>

	<p>In my case, I prefer hot weather because I'm from Canada and it's a really cold place in which we only have 3 or 4 months of summer and the other months we have low temperature.</p>

	<p>The cold generates psychological problems because you can not go out also the snow burn the skin and generates more problems than the hot weather.</p>

	<p>Also, the hot weather gives you a vacation feeling that relaxes the people also you can go out when you want and visit the beach and you can visit your family, basically, the hot weather helps you to be more sociable.</p>
