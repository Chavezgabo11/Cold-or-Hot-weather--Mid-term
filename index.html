	<h1>Why cold weather is better than hot?</h1>
	<p>In my case, I prefer cold weather because I'm from El Salvador the average weather is 25°C, and also we don't have a winter we only have two season summer season that always is over 28°C and our second season or cold weather are raining days, and that is like 3 or 4 months where the temperature can drop to 15°C that is a really cold day in El Salvador.</p>

	<p>Well as you can see we are always sweating which is a big problem that generates a bad smell. Further, you always get dehydrated.</p>

	<p>What I like about cold weather is that are easier to pass them than hot weather you only need to have a heated house and a big jacket, sweater or coat.</p>
